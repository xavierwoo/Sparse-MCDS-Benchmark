# Sparse dataset for the minimum connected dominating set problem

This benchmark contains 15 large sparse graph instances for the minimum connected dominating set problem

## Format

The first line gives the information of how many vertices and edges there are.
For the following, each line represents one edge.

```
<number of vertices> <number of edgfes>
<source id> <sink id>
<source id> <sink id>
<source id> <sink id>
...
```
